# This is an experimental implemention of a TCP/IP stack in swift.#

The whole project is just some toy codes which compile but probably won't work.

The initial goal is to create an IP stack accompanying NetworkExtension. However, I found it's just too difficult to create and maintain a correctly implemented IP stack, so may be it should be better to use a modified lwip or pico as the tun2socks library.
